in order to trial this app, you can log in with:
an employee: mike@gmail.com - password
a conractor: graham@gmail.com - password

For this app, I wanted to practice:  Angular - bootstrapCss - Single table inheritance - polymorphic assocations in particular. 

Most of the logic is found in the Dashboard.js - dashboard.controller.  

Any question, I can be reached on tmerlet@gmail.com. 

Thanks for looking!
